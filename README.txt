I created this to help further learn the Spring and Hibernate framework.

This project consists of getting information from Person located in an Oracle Database.

The user can type a user address path "/persons" and they can obtain various information 
about people in the database. They can create, read, update, and delete a person.(CRUD)

This project isn't a real world example but the purpose is for to 
further enhance my knowledge of the Spring and Hibernate framework.
