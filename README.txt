Spring MVC and Hibernate Store project.

I created this project to help further learn the Spring and Hibernate framework.

This projects will be an online store that allows customers to 
login, view all products, filter products, and add orders.

This project isn't a real world example but the purpose is for to 
further enhance my knowledge of the Spring MVC and Hibernate framework.

I am working with adding Hazelcast for in-memory caching distribution across multiple cluster.
I am also adding a Metric controller that allows and Admin user to view all hit counts for all of the rest URLS.

In the future, I want to be able to display these metrics into an internal REST endpoint that only the admin user can view.

There is a "Java Classes" folder that shows all the classes. This is so anyone can see all the classes with digging deep to the src folder to find these classes.
I also have "Test Classes"  folder to show test classes including integation and unit tests. 

I am still working on these unit and integration test as I learned how to test using the Spring MVC framework.

There is also logging that used for testing to make sure everything works. I insecure logs such as getting a person's Id from database and their name.
I left these in for my testing purposes. I will remove them eventually when I created all the unit and integration tests to ensure everything works properly.
